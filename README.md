## Description
This application allows the user to input two numbers and change text based on mathemmatical properties of those numbers.

## Parameters of the Project
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
1. For multiples of three, print "fizz" instead of the number.
2. For multiples of five, print "buzz" instead of the number.
3. For multiples of both, print "fizzBuzz" instead of the number.

## Additional Functionality

1. Modify the program by leveraging the "template" HTML tag to make it more dynamic.
2. Allow the user to enter two integers and prints the appropriate result based on multiples of the inputs.
